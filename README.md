# Simple Solar System

A Unity project that visualises our solar system with orbiting planets, created during the first few weeks of my Games Development module in second year.  
Each planet orbits the Sun with roughly scaled speeds and sizes, and the scene includes basic camera controls, a toggle to pause the orbits, and some  extras like our moon and the Universal logo orbiting Earth.

## Overview

It includes:
- Orbiting planets from Mercury to Neptune  
- A moon orbiting Earth  
- Two camera perspectives: birds-eye and close-up  
- Keyboard controls for zoom, panning, and view switching  

## Notes

Planet textures sourced from [Solar System Scope](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/).
