# Simple Solar System

A Unity project that visualises the Solar System with orbiting planets, created as during the first few weeks of my Games Development module.  
Each planet orbits the Sun with roughly scaled speeds, and the scene includes basic camera controls, a toggle to pause the orbits, and some fun extras like a moon and the Universal logo orbiting Earth.
